                "message": "*This is a veto*\n\nOh man...\n\nHow do I even start here. This map pretty much sums up the entirety of the problems of the current BN system. Low quality maps that get ranked because there is *technically* nothing wrong with them. I think in a perfect world, nobody with a conscious mind will willingly push these types of maps forward, but, nobody is perfect I guess.\n\nFall, if you have the heart as a mapper to push good quality maps to ranked, you should at least thin out about 70% of the unnecessary, bloated diffs in this set. Between them, none of them provides anything substantially \"fresh\" to the players, and are frankly made so people can play two of the same diffs and get two of the same pp scores.\n\nBut I know you will probably not listen to my advice above, so let's get to what I would consider my baseline. \n\n\n(start reading from here if you only care about the main reasons of the veto)\n[Nymphe's Extreme]\n- remove this diff.\n\n00:30:504 - to 00:49:815 - It's really amazing that you have managed to map an entire chorus that feels completely copy pasted even when it's not. This section is entirely consisted of the same back and forth motion (right to left, up and down) for almost 20 whole seconds with minimal spacing changes (it may as well have been full distance snapped).\n\n00:49:815 (1,2,3,4) - While I appreciate that you withheld the urge to spam more monotonous jumps, why is it that when the song peaks here, you decide to use sliders?\n\n00:51:194 (1,2,1) - Grouping is a bit off here, this should be a set of 3 but is mapped as 1-2 jumps\n\n01:00:849 (1,2,3,4,5,6) - What is even happening here? You just decide to map very different elements of music as up and down 1-2 jumps?\n\n00:36:022 (1,2,1,2) - what on earth is happening in the music that would support 1-2 jumps? especially considering what you did here 00:30:504 (1,2,3) - \n\nI expect this diff to have *major reworking* or *removal* to consider my veto resolved. (Though you might as well remove it since you have 17 other extras anyways)\n\n\n\nOnce again, I plead you. Thin out this set, remove unnecessary diffs, and keep it from being awfully bloated.",

This map pretty much sums up the entirety of the problems of the current BN system. Low quality maps that get ranked because there is *technically* nothing wrong with them. I think in a perfect world, nobody with a conscious mind will willingly push these types of maps forward, but, nobody is perfect I guess.\n\nFall, if you have the heart as a mapper to push good quality maps to ranked, you should at least thin out about 70% of the unnecessary, bloated diffs in this set. Between them, none of them provides anything substantially \"fresh\" to the players, and are frankly made so people can play two of the same diffs and get two of the same pp scores.\n\nBut I know you will probably not listen to my advice above, so let's get to what I would consider my baseline. \n\n\n(start reading from here if you only care about the main reasons of the veto)\n[Nymphe's Extreme]\n- remove this diff.\n\n00:30:504 - to 00:49:815 - It's really amazing that you have managed to map an entire chorus that feels completely copy pasted even when it's not. This section is entirely consisted of the same back and forth motion (right to left, up and down) for almost 20 whole seconds with minimal spacing changes (it may as well have been full distance snapped).\n\n00:49:815 (1,2,3,4) - While I appreciate that you withheld the urge to spam more monotonous jumps, why is it that when the song peaks here, you decide to use sliders?\n\n00:51:194 (1,2,1) - Grouping is a bit off here, this should be a set of 3 but is mapped as 1-2 jumps\n\n01:00:849 (1,2,3,4,5,6) - What is even happening here? You just decide to map very different elements of music as up and down 1-2 jumps?\n\n00:36:022 (1,2,1,2) - what on earth is happening in the music that would support 1-2 jumps? especially considering what you did here 00:30:504 (1,2,3) - \n\nI expect this diff to have *major reworking* or *removal* to consider my veto resolved. (Though you might as well remove it since you have 17 other extras anyways)\n\n\n\nOnce again, I plead you. Thin out this set, remove unnecessary diffs, and keep it from being awfully bloated.","created_at":"2020-09-28T21:49:08+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28T21:49:08+00:00","deleted_at":null},null,{"id":5290255,"beatmap_discussion_id":1892477,"user_id":4800816,"last_editor_id":null,"deleted_by_id":null,"system":false,"message":"so just nymphe","created_at":"2020-09-28T21:50:59+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28T21:50:59+00:00","deleted_at":null},null,null,null,null,null,{"id":5290269,"beatmap_discussion_id":1892477,"user_id":3124248,"last_editor_id":null,"deleted_by_id":null,"system":false,"message":"> none of them provides anything substantially \"fresh\" to the players\nall of them but nymphe is the worst","created_at":"2020-09-28T21:52:23+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28T21:52:23+00:00","deleted_at":null},{"id":5290270,"beatmap_discussion_id":1892477,"user_id":3193504,"last_editor_id":null,"deleted_by_id":null,"system":false,"message":">so just nymphe\nIdeally I want you to remove more.","created_at":"2020-09-28T21:52:27+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28T21:52:27+00:00","deleted_at":null},null,null,null,null,{"id":5290303,"beatmap_discussion_id":1892477,"user_id":7265097,"last_editor_id":null,"deleted_by_id":null,"system":false,"message":"big agree with the first paragraph","created_at":"2020-09-28T21:56:48+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28T21:56:48+00:00","deleted_at":null},null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,{"id":5290337,"beatmap_discussion_id":1892477,"user_id":9505704,"last_editor_id":null,"deleted_by_id":null,"system":false,"message":"dropping by to say I would've posted something to the same extent if kibb didn't already. content bloat like this is harmful and degrades other peoples' efforts in creating high quality, creative, original content - which *every* mapset should strive to be.","created_at":"2020-09-28T22:04:09+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28T22:04:09+00:00","deleted_at":null},{"id":5290338,"beatmap_discussion_id":1892477,"user_id":7265097,"last_editor_id":null,"deleted_by_id":null,"system":false,"message":"^same","created_at":"2020-09-28T22:04:32+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28T22:04:32+00:00","deleted_at":null},null,null,null,null,null,null,null,{"id":5290380,"beatmap_discussion_id":1892477,"user_id":8085312,"last_editor_id":null,"deleted_by_id":null,"system":false,"message":"so removing some diffs and fixing some parts can make the \"the entirety of the problems of the current BN system\" completely resolved?\nif you really want to resolve the BN system issues, the veto is the least minimal you could do for every single set that is of this kind","created_at":"2020-09-28T22:11:04+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28T22:11:04+00:00","deleted_at":null},null,null,null,{"id":5290386,"beatmap_discussion_id":1892477,"user_id":6175280,"last_editor_id":null,"deleted_by_id":null,"system":false,"message":"Hey shardex got a good point","created_at":"2020-09-28T22:12:16+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28T22:12:16+00:00","deleted_at":null},null,null,{"id":5290391,"beatmap_discussion_id":1892477,"user_id":7265097,"last_editor_id":7265097,"deleted_by_id":null,"system":false,"message":"actually fixing the issue would require to bns to stop nominating maps like this but we all know this isn't gonna happen lol","created_at":"2020-09-28T22:12:50+00:00","updated_at":"2020-09-28T22:12:55+00:00","deleted_at":null},null,{"id":5290396,"beatmap_discussion_id":1892477,"user_id":3533958,"last_editor_id":null,"deleted_by_id":null,"system":false,"message":"I'd greatly appreciate it if you guys didn't mention my name in regards to this set.
