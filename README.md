An event-driven osu! feeds.

## Why?
~~Because afaik, there are no open-source nomination feed for osu! We've seen Aiess and CPOL's nomination feed, but none of them are actually open sourced, therefore I'm here to bring the feed to the open source community!~~

No longer true, look over [Naxess' Aiess](https://github.com/Naxesss/Aiess) for an alternative of this.  
If you're not willing to have all the databases shinenigans and would want to have more freedom as to what you can do, feel free to use this one.

## Contributing
Contribution is always welcome (obviously)! You can create a fork, do your changes and create a pull request to improve my shitty code or add one or two features!
